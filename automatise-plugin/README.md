# Automatise Plugin

A simple WordPress plugin that provides site appearance settings, custom page fields (using ACF), automatic page creation, and indexing settings.

## Installation
1. Copy the `automatise-plugin` folder into your WordPress `wp-content/plugins` directory.
2. Activate the plugin from the WordPress admin plugins screen.


After activation, open **Site Appearance** in the admin sidebar. From this page you can configure logo, favicon, colors and select which pages appear in the header and footer. The same page also contains a button to install and activate the included theme.

## Features
 - Top-level **Site Appearance** menu for uploading a logo and favicon, picking site colors, choosing header and footer pages, and setting a redirect URL.
- Custom fields for pages: title, description, content, FAQ, and game block (requires the Advanced Custom Fields plugin).
- Automatically creates basic pages (`Home`, `About`, and `Contact`) on activation and ensures they are indexed by search engines.
- Includes a basic theme that can be installed and activated from the settings page.
